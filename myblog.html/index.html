    The universe had a humble beginning .a momentous event known as the Big Bang. <U>Approximately 13.8 billion
        years ago,</U> the cosmos erupted into existence, giving birth to time, space, and matter. This cosmic
    symphony
    set the stage for the formation of galaxies, stars, and the celestial bodies that grace our night sky.

    </ul>
    Galaxies, sprawling cities of stars, exist in various shapes and sizes, forming the backbone of the cosmic
    order. From the spiral elegance of our Milky Way to the elliptical enigma of distant galaxies, these vast
    structures harbor secrets that astronomers tirelessly work to unravel.

    Stars, those luminous spheres of brilliance, are the celestial engines that drive the cosmic narrative. Born
    from colossal clouds of gas and dust, stars illuminate the darkness and forge the elements that constitute
    the building blocks of planets and life itself. Witnessing the birth and death of stars is akin to observing
    the heartbeat of the universe.

            </h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Black holes, mysterious and powerful, exert a gravitational pull so intense that nothing, not even light,
    can escape. These cosmic behemoths result from the collapse of massive stars and continue to baffle
    scientists with their unique properties and the role they play in shaping the cosmos.
